# Determning the Likelihood of Getting Funded by Kiva Loans through Logistic Regression
Peer to peer lending (P2P) from microfinancing instituitions have developed to become an alternative source of funding to formal financial instituitions as the demand for micro-scale funding are increasing. It has become a movement for poverty alleviation to provide financial access for impoverished communities who have little to no access to financial services (Brau et al., 2004). P2P lending instituitions such as Kiva Loans promote financial inclusivity that has been particularly beneficial for small businesses that need enough capital but lack collateral assets to apply for loans. Kiva Loans has allowed lenders from all over the world to loan to low-income, small, micro, and medium enterprises and people in need for funding in developing countries.

Here is the summary of our project.
